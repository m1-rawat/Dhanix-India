I want to add Attendance Import (CSV) on the Payroll Run Details / Manage page in Dhanix.

Current behavior:

On the Payroll Run “Manage” page, I see a table of employees for that run with columns like employeeCode, name, paidDays, lopDays, otherDeductions, etc.
Right now I have to manually type paidDays (and optionally lopDays / otherDeductions) for each employee before processing the payroll run.
I want a new feature that lets me import attendance from a CSV and auto‑fill these fields in the table.

Requirements
1. UI changes on Run Details page

On the payroll run details / manage screen, above the employees table, add a button:
Label: Import Attendance
Clicking this button should open a modal/dialog (or a panel) with:
Text description of the CSV format.
A button: “Download Attendance Template” that downloads a CSV with this exact header:
text

employeeCode,paidDays,lopDays,otherDeductions
File input to upload a .csv file.
2. CSV parsing & matching (client‑side only)

Parse the CSV on the client using papaparse (we already use it for employee import; reuse or install if needed).
For each row in CSV:
employeeCode (string, required)
paidDays (number, default 0 if blank)
lopDays (number, default 0 if blank)
otherDeductions (number, default 0 if blank)
Match rows to existing employees in the current payroll run table by employeeCode.
For matched employees:
Update the row’s paidDays, lopDays, and otherDeductions fields in the UI state.
For CSV rows that don’t match any employeeCode in this run, keep a small summary (e.g. “X rows skipped – employee not found”).
3. Validation

If employeeCode is missing on a row → treat as invalid; don’t apply.
Numeric fields: if non‑numeric, treat as error (do not apply) and include that row in an “errors” summary list.
Show a simple summary in the modal after processing:
Matched & updated: N
Skipped (no employee with that code): M
Error rows (invalid data): K
Optionally, list the error rows in a small table within the modal.
4. Integration with existing Run Details logic

Do not change the backend payroll API right now.
The imported attendance should simply update whatever local state is used to hold the current rows in the Run Details page, so that when I click “Process Payroll” / “Save”, the backend receives these updated paidDays, lopDays, and otherDeductions values as if I had typed them manually.
Make sure this works only when the run is in DRAFT/unlocked state; if run is LOCKED / completed, disable or hide the “Import Attendance” button.
5. UX

Keep the UI consistent with current Dhanix styling (buttons, cards, modal).
After successful import & update of the table, close the modal automatically and maybe show a toast: “Attendance imported successfully”.
At the end, please tell me:

Which files/components you modified (especially the Run Details / Payroll Run manage page).
How to test this feature end‑to‑end.
